## papitas

### ingredients 

* potatoes, waxy yellow eg Yukon golds are best
* salt
* oil for frying

### directions

Peel and then cut potatoes into approximately one inch cubes. Boil in salted water (roughly 1/2 tsp per quart) for about 20 minutes until potatoes are tender. Drain, then fry in oil, lard, bacon grease or beef tallow or duck fat if you're feeling fancy. 
Flip potatoes gently, as they'll want to fall apart. Fry until they form a nicely browned crust on all sides and then serve hot.
