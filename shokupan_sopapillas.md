## Tangzhong 

### ingredients

* 45g water
* 45g whole milk
* 15g bread flour

### directions

Combine in a small saucepan, whisk over low-medium heat until it thickens- typically around 150F at which point the starches in the flour will gelatinize.

## Dough

Mix tangzhong with the following:

### ingredients

* 300g bread flour
* 5g salt
* 1 large egg
* 50g unsalted butter
* 15g sugar
* 7g instant yeast
* 15g dry milk powder
* 120g whole milk

### directions

Knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms. Cover and let rise for 2 hours. Punch down and roll out into 1/8" to 1/4" thick circles about 12 to 18 inches in diameter. Cut into quarters. Fry in 340F neutral oil, spooning the hot oil over the top of the sopapilla, until it puffs up and turns golden brown. Drain oil and let cool.
