## Refried Beans

* 1 can cooked pinto beans, 16oz seasoned cooked dried beans, or 1 can vegetarian refried beans
* 2 tbsp lard, rendered chicken fat or tallow
* 1/4 cup chicken or beef stock, preferably homemade
* 2-3 oz shredded cheese

Mash beans with a couple tablespoons of their cooking or can liquid in a pan over low heat. Add lard and stock. Simmer on low until about half the liquid is cooked off and the texture is nearly at the desired consistency. Add shredded cheese and continue to cook on low until cheese is melted.
