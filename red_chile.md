## red chile

### ingredients

* 8-12 whole New Mexico dried red chile pods
* 2 cups stock, pork or chicken
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 tbsp butter or lard
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* 3 cloves fresh garlic
* 1 tsp honey (optional)
* 1 tsp tomato paste (optional)

### directions

Rinse chile pods thoroughly in warm water, remove stems and seeds. Add to pot with stock. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 5-10 minutes until pods are softened.

Remove from heat and put the stock and pods into a blender. Add salt, oregano and garlic to blender. Blend until fairly smooth, set aside. Made a roux with the flour and butter or lard in the same pot on medium heat, whisk until the flour is cooked, about 5 minutes.

Add the contents of the blender to the roux and whisk together. Add the honey and/or tomato paste if desired. Lower heat to a simmer, cook everything together for 20 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. Add additional stock if it's too thick. Taste and adjust salt level if it needs it.
