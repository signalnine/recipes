## ingredients

* potatoes
* salt
* black pepper
* bacon grease, butter, lard, or vegetable oil

## directions

Cut potatoes into cubes about half an inch on each side. Heat a heavy cast iron pan to about medium heat, add a couple tablespoons of (in order of preference) bacon grease, lard, butter or vegetable oil. Salt the potatoes and allow them to absorb salt for about 5 minutes before adding to hot pan. Stir a few times and cover with a lid, the lid doesn't have to fit perfectly but it should keep most of the steam inside. Turn heat down to medium-low and stir every 3-4 minutes to keep the potatoes from sticking. It will take about 15 or 20 minutes for the potatoes to soften and start to develop some color. Once the potatoes are fully softened, turn the heat up to medium-high and remove the lid, it should take about 10 minutes to crisp them to a golden brown on at least two sides. Add freshly cracked black pepper in the last minute or so.
