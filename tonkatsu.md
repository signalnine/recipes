aka Japanese pork cutlets. Easy weeknight dinner and a staple of my household.

## ingredients

* boneless pork chops
* panko bread crumbs
* eggs
* flour
* salt
* white pepper

## directions

Pound the pork chops with a meat tenderizer or the back of a heavy knife until they're about half an inch thick. Spinkle them with salt and ground white pepper. Allow them to sit for about 20 minutes. Crack and whisk a couple eggs to dredge the cutlets. Get some panko crumbs onto a baking tray or plate and heat a pan with about an inch of oil to 375F. Sprinkle a little flour on the cutlets, both sides before dipping them in egg. Make sure the egg coats them thoroughly. Press the egg-dipped cutlets firmly in panko crumbs and coat them until every surface has sufficient bread crumbs adhered. Fry the cutlets until golden brown. Cut them into half inch strips when they've cooled a bit. Serve on steamed rice with Bulldog sauce drizzed over them and fresh shredded cabbage salad (a little seasame dressing is good) or kimchi.
