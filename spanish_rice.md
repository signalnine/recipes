## Spanish Rice

### ingredients 

* 1 small sweet onion, minced
* 2 fresh tomatoes, diced
* 1 cup short or medium grain white rice, arborio works best but I usually just use sushi rice tbh
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tsp butter
* around 12 oz good quality chicken stock, homemade ideally

Mince the onion and sweat it in a pan with the butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add rice about a minute in, making sure the grains get evenly toasted but not letting the onion get too browned. You're looking for a light tan color on the rice.
Add diced tomatoes and tomato paste, lowering the heat to medium-low. Let it simmer, adding a few tablespoons of stock at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. This is basically a risotto, so you'll need to keep stirring as you go. When the stock is fully absorbed the rice should be tender and creamy.
