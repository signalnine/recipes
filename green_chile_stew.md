## ingredients

* 2 cups green chile, chopped
* 5 good-sized potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 lb pork shoulder, cubed
* 1/2 lb bacon, chopped
* 4-6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* one medium onion, chopped (optional)
* 1/4-1/2 tsp Mexican oregano (add more if your chile is hotter, less if it's mild)
* salt to taste
* 1 qt stock, pork or chicken

## directions
Reserve 2 potatoes. Combine all remaining ingredients in a large pot, add about 2 quarts water. Boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add water if it boils down too much. Boil for about 2 hours, at which point the potatoes should have more or less dissolved. If they're not dissolving, you probably didn't chop them small enough. Fry the remaining potatoes, then add to pot, continue to cook until they're soft enough. Add salt to taste.
Serve with fresh flour tortillas.
